Password generator challenge for module 5

## Description

In this challenge I created a password generator. 
After pressing the button the user will be asked about the desired length of the password, also asked about the inclusion of different characters.
It should give an error alert and start over if the user asked for a length out of the range of 10-64.
It should give an error alert and start over if the user did not choose any character type.

There is two javascript file as my first attempt didn't guarantee the inclusion of the chosen character types.
In my second attempt I followed a different logic and created a random generator fuction for each character type array what I used later in the getRandom function.

It was a challenging and enjoyable project and with lot of googling I managed to solve it.
I feel like I am on a right path to become a master googler.

Thank you for checking out this project!
